# Threat Hunt Report (Compromised Admin Account)
**Malicious activity was detected from a compromised admin account**

## Example Scenario:
One of the administrators from the IT team calls you, the cybersecurity analyst, and tells you he is seeing some file that he has never seen before and one that he did not download; most likely due to a script. After looking into the situation more, you realize that the administrator’s account had been logged into after work hours. The goal is to analyze the events leading up to the account breach and to figure out how the file appeared on the desktop.

## High-Level TOR related IoC Discovery Plan:
1. Check DeviceFileEvents for any tor(.exe) or firefox(.exe) file events
2. Check DeviceProcessEvents for any signs of installation or usage
3. Check DeviceNetworkEvents for any signs of outgoing connections over known TOR ports

## Steps Taken by Bad Actor
1. Attempt to brute force the password in RDP with incorrect credentials
2. Successfully log in
3. Execute Malicious Powershell script: 
```
powershell.exe -EncodedCommand VwByAGkAdABlAC0ATwB1AHQAcAB1AHQAIABoAGUAbABsAG8AIAB3AG8AcgBsAGQ=

# Define the URL and the destination path
$url = "https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Ftse2.mm.bing.net%2Fth%2Fid%2FOIP.D_2umvMRIihretglyFNrlwHaEK%3Fr%3D0%26pid%3DApi&f=1&ipt=c3186ebe04803f74c7321aa6f7a1ddc64ab70f005e924506bd045c0c41df2737&ipo=images"
$output = "C:\Users\thanos\Downloads\image.jpg"

# Download the image
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri $url -OutFile $output
```
5. Download a malicious file using p: 
Note: Of course these actions are harmless for the purpose of the lab. The "malicious powershell script" prints "hello world" to the screen. And the "malicious file" is just an image of a tree.

## Detection Queries:
```kql
// Installer name == tor-browser-windows-x86_64-portable-(version).exe
// Detect the installer being downloaded
DeviceFileEvents
| where FileName startswith "tor"

// TOR Browser being silently installed
// Take note of two spaces before the /S (I don't know why)
DeviceProcessEvents
| where ProcessCommandLine contains "tor-browser-windows-x86_64-portable-14.0.1.exe  /S"
| project Timestamp, DeviceName, ActionType, FileName, ProcessCommandLine

// TOR Browser or service was successfully installed and is present on the disk
DeviceFileEvents
| where FileName has_any ("tor.exe", "firefox.exe")
| project  Timestamp, DeviceName, RequestAccountName, ActionType, InitiatingProcessCommandLine

// TOR Browser or service was launched
DeviceProcessEvents
| where ProcessCommandLine has_any("tor.exe","firefox.exe")
| project  Timestamp, DeviceName, AccountName, ActionType, ProcessCommandLine

// TOR Browser or service is being used and is actively creating network connections
DeviceNetworkEvents
| where InitiatingProcessFileName in~ ("tor.exe", "firefox.exe")
| where RemotePort in (9001, 9030, 9040, 9050, 9051, 9150)
| project Timestamp, DeviceName, InitiatingProcessAccountName, InitiatingProcessFileName, RemoteIP, RemotePort, RemoteUrl
| order by Timestamp desc

// User shopping list was created and, changed, or deleted
DeviceFileEvents
